# ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è BJJ training goal tracker ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A quick little web app interface I built to record and track my BJJ training progress. The goal was to reach 100 classes in a year, though COVID-19 threw a wrench in those plans.

[View demo](https://bbag.github.io/bjj-goal-tracker/)

To-do:
- [x] Allow for customization of goal total (# of classes).
- [x] Clickable table of contents at the top to quickly scroll to certain sections.
- [x] Progress bars to compare % of year passed versus % of goal completed.
- [x] Reactive SVG donut chart to show breakdown of types of classes taken.
- [x] Reactive list of classes taken, with ability to add remove classes.
- [x] Fun facts about the current goal trajectory. :)
- [x] Yearly calendar showing dates and types of training done.
- [ ] Setup app to use local storage to save/load newly entered/deleted classes.
- [ ] Injury counter & heatmap on SVG body outline to see where I'm most breakable. :(
- [ ] Proper styles for the progress bars when no training class data exists.
- [ ] Color key under calendar.
